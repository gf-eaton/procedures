Personnal notes on our avancÃ©

In a week I can say we are pretty much advance on the CoDeSys : 

 - [ ] (percentage) means how close are we to the goal fixed, plus, are we able to reproduce ?

## Week : 2023-10-01 to 2023-10-06

 - [x] Setup : codesys, smp lib, etc ... (100%)
 - [x] .par files : points, modbus client, mapping, subscribe, multiple DA/HW (100%)
 - [x] DA-3000 : firmware update, deploy configuration (100%)
 - [x] Overall architecture : miro diagram of our thinking (90%)
 - [x] Phase 1) DEV/EXP Source code (in codesys) sync live points smp --> plc variable, function-block, method, function, extend, pointer of ..., build, run, debug (100%)
 - [ ] Phase 2a) DEV/EXP : state machine simulation : goal is to benchmark the PLC in a pseudo-real scenario (10%)
 - [ ] Phase 2b) DEV/EXP : dynamic config state/transition at runtime. Reload of config without buil/rebuild (concept proven)
 - [ ] Phase 3) codesys migration soon
 - [ ] Test : Integrated testing initiated (x%)
 - [x] Known Issues : bug found in sync function (in codesys for 3.5.19) under investigation

## Week : 2023-10-08 to 2023-1013

 - [ ] Phase 2) DEV/EXP : state machine simulation : goal is to benchmark the PLC in a pseudo-real scenario (10%)
 - [ ] Phase 3) codesys migration soon
