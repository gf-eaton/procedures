Personnal notes on our avancÃ©

In a week I can say we are pretty much advance on the CoDeSys : 

 - [ ] (percentage) means how close to the goal fixed are we plus are we able to reproduce ?

## Week : 2023-10-01 to 2023-10-06

Setup : codesys, smp lib, etc ... (100%)
.par files : points, modbus client, mapping, subscribe, multiple DA/HW (100%)
DA-3000 : firmware update, deploy configuration (100%)
Overall architecture : miro diagram of our thinking (90%)
Phase 1) DEV/EXP Source code (in codesys) sync live points smp --> plc variable, function-block, method, function, extend, pointer of ..., build, run, debug (100%)
Phase 2) DEV/EXP : state machine simulation : goal is to benchmark the PLC in a pseudo-real scenario (10%)
Phase 3) codesys migration soon
Known Issues : bug found in sync function (in codesys for 3.5.19) under investigation

## Week : 2023-10-08 to 2023-1013

Phase 2) DEV/EXP : state machine simulation : goal is to benchmark the PLC in a pseudo-real scenario (10%)
Phase 3) codesys migration soon
